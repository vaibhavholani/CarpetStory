  *Problem:* Client owns a carpet store in Jaipur which deals with handmade designer carpets.
  Client has already got a website built to showcase the carpets to the proposed buyers. The
  proposed buyers usually visit the store physically or visit the website and select some of
  them for a demo at their homes before buying as these carpets are quite expensive and
  cannot be changed frequently. The selected carpets are then sent for demo by the client at
  his own cost. The demo holds importance as the buyers finally select the carpets basing on
  the interior of their houses. However, the process is not an easy one, it obviously leads to
  wastage of time of the employees as the carpets need to be sent with faithful workers only.
  Many times, the carpets get spoilt during transition, which leads to huge loss. The demo
  does not prove to be feasible as all the carpets cannot be taken at once leaving the store
  empty. Again, demo doesn’t provide assurance of buying by the buyers. Providing demo to
  outstation buyers is not possible for the client, which leads to loss of potential buyers. The
  existing website is not able to give any feature like providing demo or having the carpets
  sorted according to user’s preference. Right now, there is no provision for the proposed
  buyers of the client to select the carpets and store the viewed carpets for future reference
  
  *Solution:* The solution which I proposed was to build an app using the latest augmented reality
  technology to provide a demo to all the proposed buyers. Thus, they could view the 3D
  models of various carpets on their smart phones, which could prove to be very handy. The
  app will give an opportunity to place the carpets virtually in their interiors for a demo. This
  will enable them to see whether the carpet matches the interior or not. The solution will save
  the time and resources of my client. This app will have a feature of storing the customers’
  preferences by having favourite feature attached to it. It can also give facility to sort the
  carpets according to user’s choice. Client will also have the credential to manage the carpet
  images and descriptions. Client can see the preferences of the potential buyers and derive
  useful information to get new carpets. All the updates in the store will be visible to buyers in
  no time. So, I am planning to use firebase, a real-time database as the backend of the app.
